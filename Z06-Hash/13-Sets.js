/**
 * Introduction to Sets
 * 
 * A Set is similar to a Map or an Object, except that instead of having key/value pairs, they only have the keys but not the
 * values.
 * 
 * Sets store a collection of unique elements (in other words, they do not allow duplicates).
 * 
 * In JavaScript, you can use the Set object to create and work with sets.
 */

/**
 * Here's a simple example to create a set:
 * 
 * // Create a new set
 * let mySet = new Set()
 * 
 * // Add elements to the set
 * mySet.add(1)
 * mySet.add(2)
 * mySet.add(3)
 * mySet.add(4)
 * mySet.add(5)
 * 
 * 
 * Once you have created a set, you can do various things with it, like adding or removing elements and checking if
 * a particular element exists in the set.
 * 
 * Here are some examples of common set operations in JavaScript:
 * 
 * // Add an element to the Set
 * // If the number 6 is already in the set, it won't be added again
 * mySet.add(6)
 * 
 * // Remove an element from the Set
 * mySet.delete(3)
 * 
 * // Clear all elements from the Set
 * mySet.clear()
 * 
 * // Check if an element exists in the Set
 * if(mySet.has(4)){
 *  console.log("Found 4 in mySet")
 * }
 * 
 * // Size of the set
 * console.log(mySet.size)
 */

/**
 * You can also do more advanced operations like converting sets to arrays and vice-versa, or iterating through sets:
 * 
 * // Convert Set to an array
 * let myArray = Array.from(mySet)
 * 
 * // Convert array to a set
 * let arrayToSet = new Set(myArray)
 * 
 * // Iterate through the set
 * mySet.forEach(function(value){
 *  console.log(value)
 * })
