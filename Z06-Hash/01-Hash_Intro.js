/**
 * 
 * Collision is when we maps items to the same spot in memory.
 * 
 * The process of putting all of the key-value pairs that map to particular address in the same address space is called separate chaining.
 * 
 * Another approach is if there is alrady an item at this address space, let's go the next one and see if it's open and if it is then put it there. This is called linear probing.
 * 
 * The two most common is Linear probing and Separate chaining.
