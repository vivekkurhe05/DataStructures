/**
 * 
 * Heap looks like a binary search tree, and a heap is a binary tree, but the numbers are laid out in a different way.
 * In heap, each node has a value that is greater than each of its descendents
 * 
 * A key characteristic of heap is that the tree will always be complete
 */

/**
 * One of the differences between heap and binary search tree is in heap you can have duplicates
 * 
 * Note: We implement heap with an array, not with a node class.
